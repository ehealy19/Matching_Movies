  This work will investigate the impact of gender bias in the film industry pertaining to economic outcomes. Specifically, it will establish a causal link between a film casting a female actress in the leading role and the resulting box-office revenue. This will be accomplished utilizing propensity weighting, which will match movies based on the perceived similarity of their characteristics. These predictor variables will include the year, season of release, genre, runtime, director and writers, star power level of the cast, MPAA rating, IMDb Metascore, IMDb Votes, number of awards won, country of release, language, film description, the production budget, the aspect ratio, the color, the countries of origin, filming locations, production companies, and tagline. To deal with the variables that are non-numeric the following steps will be taken. Firstly, a network analysis will be performed on the cast to produce a measure of centrality of the actors/actresses. Secondly, a sentiment analysis will be performed on the film description and tagline. The primary outcome variable will be the box-office number measured in US dollars, measured as the gross value worldwide. The IMDb score will be employed as an additional outcome measure to be used as a robustness check. A secondary robustness check may be employed in which the primary variable of interest will be whether the film passes the Bechdel test, indicating true female representation in the film. The initial hypothesis is that films that opt to feature a female in the leading role will experience a decrease value in the box office revenue.

### Causality

My previous paper: [Behind the Box Office: Directorial Influence on Film Revenue in the United States Entertainment Industry](./assets/thesis.pdf) attempted to analyze the link between director quality and box-office success of a film. The paper created two novel measures of director quality; a summation of all box-office revenue earned by and the director's films and the accumulated number of critical awards from the fifteen years leading up to the film in question. The main dependent variable was domestic box-office revenue and a robustness check was implemented changing the dependent variable to the IMDb rating earned. 

![](./assets/thesis_table1.png)
![](./assets/thesis_table2.png)

The paper found an increase in director financial quality yielded between a 0.0289% and 0.0307% increas in domestic gross and no impact on IMDb rating. Conversely, director quality in terms of critical acclaim yielded no significant impact on domestic gross, but betweeen 0.01803 and 0.0270 point increase in IMDb rating. The paper also discovered a statistically significant decrease in domestic gross for demale directors as compared to male directors.

Overall, the results were thought-provoking, however, the methodology used was lacking in the causality department. This paper, if anything, worked towards establishing a weak association due to it statical analysis going only so far as a simple ordinary-least-squares regression and controlling for confounding variables. While, the variables were considered and included in the regression equation, they were all treated equally as controls, thus a more complex analysis is warranted. 

Furthermore, I wanted to investigate the conclusion of gender bias further and shifted this analysis to examine actors instead of directors.

Moving forward, the work to get to causality includes introducing causality instead of just controlling for all covariates.

Thus, this paper will investigate the impact of gender bias in the film industry pertaining to economic outcomes. Specifically, it will attempt to establish a causal link between a film casting a female actress in the leading role and the resulting box-office revenue by employing propensity score matching.

Need to argue that there is sufficient common support between the treatment and control groups in a dataset in order to use propensity scores.

## Methodology {#sec-meth}

### Sentiment Analysis of tagline and description

BERT model for sentiment analysis \
created labels of 0/1 for tagline and movie description

### Creation of the starpower variable

Collected lists of A-list and B-list actors/actresses \
Added 2 points if one of the cast members was A-list \
Added 1 point if one of the cast members was B-list \
Averaged by dividing score by 3 (number of cast members)

### Propensity score matching

StandardScaler
Propensity scores calculated

### Robustness Checks

Implemented the IMDb score as the outcome variable as a robustness check \
Does a female in the lead role impact the critical success of the film?

## Results {#sec-results}

### Box Office Results

Female-lead had higher box-office average

### IMDb Rating Results

Female-lead had lower IMDb scores

| Gender of Lead Role     | Box Office | IMDb Rating |
|---------------------|------|------|
| Female             | 62,708,871.36 | 6.329 |
| Male               | 61,076,707.45 | 6.601 |

## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

### Limitations:
1. More data
2. Network Analysis
3. Robustness Checks with Bechdel test
4. Inacurracy from matching female leads & first actor not always the lead
5. Unbalanced Dataset (is this an issue?)
