Specifically, it will establish a causal link between a film casting a female actress in the leading role and the resulting box-office revenue. This will be accomplished utilizing propensity weighting, which will match movies based on the perceived similarity of their characteristics. These predictor variables will include the year, season of release, genre, runtime, director and writers, star power level of the cast, MPAA rating, IMDb Metascore, IMDb Votes, number of awards won, country of release, language, film description, the production budget, the aspect ratio, the color, the countries of origin, filming locations, production companies, and tagline. To deal with the variables that are non-numeric the following steps will be taken. Firstly, a network analysis will be performed on the cast to produce a measure of centrality of the actors/actresses. Secondly, a sentiment analysis will be performed on the film description and tagline. The primary outcome variable will be the box-office number measured in US dollars, measured as the gross value worldwide. The IMDb score will be employed as an additional outcome measure to be used as a robustness check. A secondary robustness check may be employed in which the primary variable of interest will be whether the film passes the Bechdel test, indicating true female representation in the film. The initial hypothesis is that films that opt to feature a female in the leading role will experience a decrease value in the box office revenue.\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Earthquake data for the island of La Palma from the September 2021 eruption is found ...\nkey-points:\n  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogr√†phico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis\n  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.\ndate: last-modified\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Film Data Science\nnumber-sections: true\njupyter: python3\nkernel: dsan5650\n---\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n::: {#1d1216ca .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code .hidden}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n#| label: fig-timeline\n#| fig-cap: Visual of the \n#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{#b74fd9a3 .cell .markdown}\n### Causality\n\nMy previous paper: [Behind the Box Office: Directorial Influence on Film Revenue in the United States Entertainment Industry](./assets/thesis.pdf) attempted to analyze the link between director quality and box-office success of a film. The paper created two novel measures of director quality; a summation of all box-office revenue earned by and the director's films and the accumulated number of critical awards from the fifteen years leading up to the film in question. The main dependent variable was domestic box-office revenue and a robustness check was implemented changing the dependent variable to the IMDb rating earned. \n\n![](./assets/thesis_table1.png)\n![](./assets/thesis_table2.png)\n\nThe paper found an increase in director financial quality yielded between a 0.0289% and 0.0307% increas in domestic gross and no impact on IMDb rating. Conversely, director quality in terms of critical acclaim yielded no significant impact on domestic gross, but betweeen 0.01803 and 0.0270 point increase in IMDb rating. The paper also discovered a statistically significant decrease in domestic gross for demale directors as compared to male directors.\n\nOverall, the results were thought-provoking, however, the methodology used was lacking in the causality department. This paper, if anything, worked towards establishing a weak association due to it statical analysis going only so far as a simple ordinary-least-squares regression and controlling for confounding variables. While, the variables were considered and included in the regression equation, they were all treated equally as controls, thus a more complex analysis is warranted. \n\nFurthermore, I wanted to investigate the conclusion of gender bias further and shifted this analysis to examine actors instead of directors.\n\nMoving forward, the work to get to causality includes introducing causality instead of just controlling for all covariates.\n\nThus, this paper will investigate the impact of gender bias in the film industry pertaining to economic outcomes. Specifically, it will attempt to establish a causal link between a film casting a female actress in the leading role and the resulting box-office revenue by employing propensity score matching.\n\nData collection and preparation is discussed in @sec-data.\n\nMethodology and propensity scoring is discussed in @sec-meth\n\nResults and anlysis are disucssed in @sec-results\n\nConluding remarks, limitations, and future work are discussed in @sec-conclusion\n\n## Data {#sec-data}\n\nData was collected from IMDb utilizing two separate APIs: OMDB and TMDB. \n\n| Name                | Year |\n|---------------------|------|\n| Female Leads    | 484 |\n| Male Leads      | 1001 |\n\n: Male versus Female Director {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history\n\n## Methodology {#sec-meth}\n\n### Sentiment Analysis of tagline and description\n\n### Creation of the starpower variable\n\n### Creation of the variable that indicates female in leading role\n\n### Propensity score matching\n\n### Robustness Checks\n\n## Results {#sec-results}\n\n### Box Office Results\n\n### IMDb Rating Results\n\n| Gender of Lead Role     | Box Office | IMDb Rating |\n|---------------------|------|------|\n| Female             | 62,708,871.36 | 6.329 |\n| Male               | 61,076,707.45 | 6.601 |\n\n## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}\n\n### Limitations:\n1.
